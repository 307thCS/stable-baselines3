This is a fork of stable-baselines3. The main feature is td3_m, which is TD3 modified to have a multiheaded actor. There are a few other things I'm working on, e.g. bit is TD3 + multiheaded actor + another technique I'm working on called IPAQ; however it doesn't improve performance right now. Thanks for looking!
